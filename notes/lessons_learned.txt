Lessons Learned

Instance IDs are apparently stored as reals, but you can reference properties of them
using dot notation in code? And you can declare a variable in the IDE as a real and yet
set it to "noone". Typing seems very loose in the IDE, although the documentation does
talk about several distinct types under the hood.

When drawing object sprites to GUI layer, the object's collision (and therefore mouse/touch)
input box still exists at its world coordinates. So if you change the camera such that 
cameraX or cameraY coordinates no longer match world x/y coordinates, a click on the object's
visual in the GUI won't register as a click on the object in the room. So it's just so easy
to just draw objects on the GUI and have clickable GUI elements.
